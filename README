Vicious
-------
Vicious is a modular widget library for the "awesome" window manager,
derived from the "Wicked" widget library. It has some of the old
Wicked widget types, a few of them rewritten, and a good number of new
ones:

  - http://git.sysphere.org/vicious/about/

Vicious widget types are a framework for creating your own awesome
widgets. Vicious contains modules that gather data about your system,
and a few helper functions that make it easier to register timers,
suspend widgets and so on.

For now Vicious doesn't depend on any third party Lua libraries, to
make it easier to install and use. That means some system utilities
are used instead, where available:

  - hddtemp        for the HDD Temperature widget type
  - alsa-utils     for the Volume widget type
  - wireless_tools for the Wireless widget type
  - curl           for widget types accessing network resources


Usage
-----
To use vicious move it to your awesome configuration directory in
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME (usually ~/.config):

  $ mv vicious $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/

If you want you can disable widgets you will not use, to avoid having
useless modules sitting in your memory. You can comment out any widget
type from the "Configure widgets" list in the widgets/init.lua file.

Then add the following to the top of your rc.lua:

  require("vicious")

Once you create a widget (a textbox, graph or a progressbar) call
vicious.register() to register it with Vicious:

  vicious.register(widget, wtype, format, interval, warg)

    widget
      - widget created with widget() or awful.widget() (in case of a
        graph or a progressbar)

    wtype
      - one of the available widget types, see below for a list

    format
      - string argument or a function
        - $1, $2, $3... will be replaced by their respective value
          returned by the widget type, some widget types return tables
          with string keys, in that case use: ${key}
      - function
        - function(widget, args) can be used to manipulate data
          returned by the widget type, more about this below

    interval
      - number of seconds between updates of the widget, 2s by
        default, also read the "Power" section below

    warg
      - some widget types require an argument to be passed, for example
        the battery ID


Other functions
---------------
Unregister a widget:
  vicious.unregister(widget, keep)

    - if keep is true widget will be suspended, waiting to be
      activated

Suspend all widgets:
  vicious.suspend()

    - example automation script for the "laptop-mode-tools" start-stop
      module: http://sysphere.org/~anrxc/local/sources/lmt-vicious.sh

Restart suspended widgets:
  vicious.activate(widget)

    - if widget is provided only that widget will be activated

Enable caching of a widget type:
  vicious.cache(wtype)

    - enable caching of values returned by a widget type

Force update of widgets:
  vicious.force({ widget, })

    - widget argument is a table with one or more widgets that will be
      updated

Custom widget types
-------------------
Use any of the existing widget types as a starting point for your
own. Write a quick worker function that does the work and plug it
in. How data will be formatted, will it be red or blue, should be
defined in rc.lua (or somewhere else, outside the actual module).

Before writing a widget type you should check if there is already one
in the contrib directory of Vicious. The contrib directory contains
extra widgets you can use. Some are for less common hardware, and
other were contributed by Vicious users. The contrib directory also
holds widget types that were obsoleted or rewritten. Contrib widgets
will not be imported by init unless you explicitly enable it.

Richard Kolkovich, a FreeBSD user, published his vicious-fbsd
branch. If you are also a BSD user you can find his work here:

  - http://git.sigil.org/vicious-fbsd/

Some users would like to avoid writing new modules. For them Vicious
kept the old Wicked functionality, possibility to register their own
functions as widget types. By providing them as the second argument to
vicious.register. Your function can accept "format" and "warg"
arguments, just like workers.


Power and Caching
-----------------
When a lot of widgets are in use they, and awesome, can generate a lot
of wake-ups and also be very expensive for system resources. This is
especially important when running on battery power. It was a big
problem with awesome v2 and widgets that used shell scripts to gather
data, and with widget libraries written in languages like Ruby.

Lua is an extremely fast and efficient programming language, and
Vicious takes advantage of that. But suspending Vicious widgets is one
way to prevent them from draining your battery, despite that.

Update intervals also play a big role, and you can save a lot of power
with a smart approach. Don't use intervals like: 5, 10, 30, 60... to
avoid harmonics. If you take the 60-second mark as an example, all of
your widgets would be executed at that point. Instead think about
using only prime numbers, in that case you will have only a few
widgets executed at any given time interval. When choosing intervals
also consider what a widget actually does. Some widget types read
files that reside in memory, others call external utilities and some,
like the mbox widget, read big files.

Vicious can also cache values returned by widget types. Caching
enables you to have multiple widgets using the same widget type. With
caching its worker function gets executed only once - which is also
great for saving power.

  - Some widget types keep internal data and if you call one multiple
    times without caching, the widget that executes it first would
    modify stored values. This can lead to problems and give you
    inconsistent data. Remember it for widget types like CPU and
    Network usage, which compare the old set of data with the new one
    to calculate current usage.

  - Widget types that require a widget argument to be passed should be
    handled carefully. If you are requesting information for different
    devices then caching should not be used, because you could get
    inconsistent data.


Security
--------
At the moment only one widget type (Gmail) requires auth. information
in order to get to the data. In the future there could be more, and
you should give some thought to the issue of protecting your data. The
Gmail widget type by default stores login information in the ~/.netrc
file, and you are advised to make sure that file is only readable by
the owner. Other than that we can not force all users to conform to
one standard, one way of keeping it secure, like in some keyring.

First let's clear why we simply don't encrypt the login information
and store it in ciphertext. By exposing the algorithm anyone can
reverse the encryption steps. Some claim even that's better than
plaintext but it's just security trough obscurity.

Here are some ideas actually worth your time. Users that have KDE (or
parts of it) installed could store their login information into the
Kwallet service and request it via DBus from the widget type. It can
be done with tools like "dbus-send" and "qdbus". The Gnome keyring
should support the same, so those with parts of Gnome installed could
use that keyring.

Users of GnuPG (and its agent) could consider encrypting the netrc
file with their GPG key. Trough the GPG Passphrase Agent they could
then decrypt the file transparently while their session is active.


Usage examples
--------------
Start with a simple widget, like date. Then build your setup from
there, one widget at a time. Also remember that besides creating and
registering widgets you have to add them to a wibox (statusbar) in
order to actually display them.

Date widget
  datewidget = widget({ type = "textbox" })
  vicious.register(datewidget, vicious.widgets.date, "%b %d, %R")

  - updated every 2 seconds (the default interval), uses standard
    date sequences as the format string

Memory widget
  memwidget = widget({ type = "textbox" })
  vicious.cache(vicious.widgets.mem)
  vicious.register(memwidget, vicious.widgets.mem, "$1 ($2MB/$3MB)", 13)

  - updated every 13 seconds, appends "MB" to 2nd and 3rd returned
    values and enables caching of this widget type

HDD temperature widget
  hddtempwidget = widget({ type = "textbox" })
  vicious.register(hddtempwidget, vicious.widgets.hddtemp, "${/dev/sda} °C", 19)

  - updated every 19 seconds, requests the temperature level of the
    {/dev/sda} key/disk and appends "°C" to the returned value, does
    not provide the port argument so default port is used

Mbox widget
  mboxwidget = widget({ type = "textbox" })
  vicious.register(mboxwidget, vicious.widgets.mbox, "$1", 5, "/home/user/mail/Inbox")

  - updated every 5 seconds, provides full path to the mbox as an
    argument

Battery widget
  batwidget = awful.widget.progressbar()
  batwidget:set_width(8)
  batwidget:set_height(10)
  batwidget:set_vertical(true)
  batwidget:set_background_color("#494B4F")
  batwidget:set_border_color(nil)
  batwidget:set_color("#AECF96")
  batwidget:set_gradient_colors({ "#AECF96", "#88A175", "#FF5656" })
  vicious.register(batwidget, vicious.widgets.bat, "$2", 61, "BAT0")

  - updated every 61 seconds, requests the current battery charge
    level and displays a progressbar, provides "BAT0" battery ID as an
    argument

CPU usage widget
  cpuwidget = awful.widget.graph()
  cpuwidget:set_width(50)
  cpuwidget:set_background_color("#494B4F")
  cpuwidget:set_color("#FF5656")
  cpuwidget:set_gradient_colors({ "#FF5656", "#88A175", "#AECF96" })
  vicious.register(cpuwidget, vicious.widgets.cpu, "$1", 3)

  - updated every 3 seconds, feeds the graph with total usage
    percentage of all CPUs/cores


Format functions
----------------
You can use a function instead of a string as the format parameter.
Then you are able to check the value returned by the widget type and
change it or perform some action. You can change the color of the
battery widget when it goes below a certain point, hide widgets when
they return a certain value or maybe use string.format for padding.

  - Do not confuse this with just coloring the widget, in those cases
    standard pango markup can be inserted into the format string.

The format function will get the widget as its first argument, table
with the values otherwise inserted into the format string as its
second argument, and will return the text/data to be used for the
widget.

Example
  mpdwidget = widget({ type = "textbox" })
  vicious.register(mpdwidget, vicious.widgets.mpd,
    function (widget, args)
      if   args["{state}"] == "Stop" then return ""
      else return '<span color="white">MPD:</span> '..
             args["{Artist}"]..' - '.. args["{Title}"]
      end
    end)

  - hides the mpd widget when no song is playing, updated every 2
    seconds (the default interval)

Example
  uptimewidget = widget({ type = "textbox" })
  vicious.register(uptimewidget, vicious.widgets.uptime,
    function (widget, args)
      return string.format("Uptime: %2dd %02d:%02d ", args[1], args[2], args[3])
    end, 61)

  - uses string.format for padding uptime values to a minimum amount
    of digits, updated every 61 seconds

When it comes to padding it is also useful to mention how a widget can
be configured to have a fixed width. You can set a fixed width on your
textbox widgets by changing their .width field (by default width is
automatically adapted to text width).

Example
  uptimewidget = widget({ type = "textbox" })
  uptimewidget.width, uptimewidget.align = 50, "right"
  vicious.register(uptimewidget, vicious.widgets.uptime, "$1 $2:$3", 61)

  - forces a fixed width of 50px to the uptime widget, and aligns its
    text to the right
