Changes in 2.4.0
----------------

.. important::

   ``volume`` now uses ðŸ”‰ and ðŸ”ˆ instead of â™« and â™© to show mute state.
   This BREAKS backward compatibility if users substitute custom symbols
   from these default.

Added:

- notmuch_all, cpu_freebsd widget types.
- [cmus_all] Promote to ``widgets/``.
- [wifiiw_linux] Expose BSSID.
- [wifi_linux] Expose frequency and transmission power.
- ``spawn`` as a fallback for ``awful.spawn`` in case Vicious is used as
  a stand-alone library. This wrapper, however, does NOT provide the facilities
  to asynchronously spawn new processes. It also lacks a few features such as
  parsing ``stderr`` and returning PID.
- ``helpers.setasyncall`` to avoid writing redundant workers for asynchronous
  widget types. Note that these workers are only needed in case Vicious is used
  as a stand-alone library.
- ``helpers.setcall`` for registering functions as widget types.
- ``headergen`` script for automatic generation of copyright notices.
- ``templates`` for the ease of adding new widget types.
- ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` which guide contributors through the steps
  of filing an issue or submitting a patch.

Fixed:

- Deprecate the use of ``io.popen`` in following widgets:

  - wifi_linux, wifiiw_linux, hwmontemp_linux, hddtemp_linux
  - bat_freebsd, mem_freebsd, net_freebsd, thermal_freebsd, uptime_freebsd,
  - cpu_freebsd, cpufreq_freebsd, fanspeed_freebsd
  - bat_openbsd
  - volume, gmail, mdir, mpd, fs

- [mpd] Lua 5.3 compatibility (for real this time); also correct a typo
- [mbox] Update the deprecated ``string.gfind`` to ``string.gmatch``
- [pkg,weather,contrib/btc] Allow function call without Awesome
- [pkg] Use more updated front-ends for Debian/Ubuntu (apt) and Fedora (dnf)
- [os] Splitted os_all into os_linux and os_bsd (and refactored to async)
- Tweak ``.luacheckrc`` to suit functional style and soft-limit text width to 80
- Update copyright headers for libraries and widget types

Removed:

- ``helpers.sysctl`` and ``helpers.sysctl_table`` were removed in favour of
  ``helpers.sysctl_async``.
